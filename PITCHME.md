#### What is validation in Javascript?

The action of validating data - both in the client and server.

- Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had entered all the        necessary data and then pressed the Submit button. 

- If the data entered by the user was incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have to send all the data back to the client and request that the form be resubmitted with correct information. This was really a lengthy process which used to put a lot of burden on the server.

#### Two functionalities of JS Validations

JavaScript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions.

- Basic form validation

    First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. It would require just a loop through each field in the form and check for data.
- Data Format Validation 

    Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct format and value. Your code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data.
