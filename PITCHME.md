#### What is validation in Javascript?

@size[25px](The action of validating data - both in the client and server.)

- @size[25px](Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had entered    all the necessary data and then pressed the Submit button.)

- @size[25px](If the data entered by the user was incorrect or was simply missing, the server       would have to send all the data back to the client and request that the form be resubmitted       with correct information. This was really a lengthy process which used to put a lot of burden     on the server.)

#### Two functionalities of JS Validations

@size[25px](JavaScript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions.)

- @size[30px](*Basic form validation*)

    @size[25px](First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. It would require just a loop through each field in the form and check for data.)

- @size[30px](*Data Format Validation* )

    @size[25px](Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct format and value. Your code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data.)
